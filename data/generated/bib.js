        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is widely used in medical field, and machine learning has been increasingly used in health care, prediction, and diagnosis and as a method of determining priority. Machine learning methods have been features of several tools in the fields of obstetrics and childcare. This present review aims to summarize the machine learning techniques to predict perinatal complications. To identify the applicability and performance of machine learning methods used to identify pregnancy complications. A total of 98 articles were obtained with the keywords \"machine learning,\" \"deep learning,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and accordingly as they related to perinatal complications (\"complications in pregnancy,\" \"pregnancy complications\") from three scientific databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. These were managed on the Mendeley platform and classified using the PRISMA method. A total of 31 articles were selected after elimination according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The features used to predict perinatal complications were primarily electronic medical records (48%), medical images (29%), and biological markers (19%), while 4% were based on other types of features, such as sensors and fetal heart rate. The main perinatal complications considered in the application of machine learning thus far are pre-eclampsia and prematurity. In the 31 studies, a total of sixteen complications were predicted. The main precision metric used is the AUC. The machine learning methods with the best results were the prediction of prematurity from medical images using the support vector machine technique, with an accuracy of 95.7%, and the prediction of neonatal mortality with the XGBoost technique, with 99.7% accuracy. It is important to continue promoting this area of research and promote solutions with multicenter clinical applicability through machine learning to reduce perinatal complications. This systematic review contributes significantly to the specialized literature on artificial intelligence and women's health.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is growing exponentially in various fields, including medicine. This paper reviews the pertinent aspects of AI in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN)\u00a0and how these can be applied to improve patient outcomes and reduce the healthcare costs\u00a0and workload for clinicians. Herein, we will address current AI uses in OB/GYN, and the use of AI as a tool to interpret fetal heart rate (FHR) and cardiotocography (CTG) to aid in the detection of preterm labor, pregnancy complications, and review\u00a0discrepancies in its interpretation between clinicians to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. AI systems can be used as tools to create algorithms identifying asymptomatic women with short cervical length who are at risk of preterm birth. Additionally, the benefits of using the vast data capacity of AI storage can assist in determining the risk factors for preterm labor using multiomics and extensive genomic data. In the field of gynecological surgery, the use of augmented reality helps surgeons detect vital structures, thus decreasing complications, reducing operative time, and helping surgeons in training to practice in a realistic setting. Using three-dimensional (3D) printers can provide materials that mimic real tissues and also helps trainees to practice on a realistic model. Furthermore, 3D imaging allows better depth perception than its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart, allowing the surgeon to create preoperative plans according to tissue depth and dimensions. Although AI has some limitations, this new technology can improve the prognosis and management of patients, reduce healthcare costs, and help OB/GYN practitioners to reduce their workload and increase their efficiency and accuracy by incorporating AI systems into their daily practice. AI has the potential to guide practitioners in decision-making, reaching a diagnosis, and improving case management. It can reduce healthcare costs by decreasing medical errors and providing more dependable predictions. AI systems can accurately provide information on the large array of patients in clinical settings, although more robust data is required.",

One such disease or disorder is a congenital disease that affects the newborn infant or unborn foetus by different viruses carried by the mother and passed on to the baby either during the time of pregnancy or delivery. Based on PRISMA guidelines, an extensive survey has been done to predict congenital diseases, including neonatal and postnatal. We have considered 115 articles related to the prediction of congenital diseases such as Zika virus, congenital heart disease, chromosome anomalies, sepsis, hypertension, cytomegalovirus, and many more using artificial intelligence published from 2008 to 2022 on different databases, journals, and conferences. In addition, the review also depicts the current work done by several researchers in the field of congenital disease prediction, along with their datasets and limitations. For complete work, we have designed four investigations and, in the end, explored solutions for the same. From the survey, it has been found that irrespective of various approaches used in the reported work, they can achieve predicted outcomes, but still, several problems need to be resolved. Thus, there is a need for more extensive research to deal with the challenges in the area of predicting various congenital diseases in the early stages.",

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence has been widely applied to a majority of research areas, including health and medicine. Certain complications or disorders that can appear during pregnancy can endanger the life of both mother and fetus. There is enough scientific literature to support the idea that emotional aspects can be a relevant risk factor in pregnancy (such as anxiety, stress or depression, for instance). This paper presents a scoping review of the scientific literature from the past 12 years (2008-2020) to identify which methodologies, techniques, algorithms and frameworks are used in Artificial Intelligence and Affective Computing for pregnancy health and well-being. The methodology proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, in conjunction with PRISMA-ScR framework has been used to create this review. Despite the relevance that emotional status can have as a risk factor during pregnancy, one of the main findings of this study is that there is still not a significant amount of literature on automatic analysis of emotion. Health enhancement and well-being for pregnant women can be achieved with artificial intelligence or affective computing based devices, hence future work on this topic is strongly suggested.",

We performed a systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) aimed to evaluate the use and performance of AI/ML models in detecting fetuses at risk of IUGR. We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA checklist. We searched for studies in all the principal medical databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane). To assess the quality of the studies we used the JBI and CASP tools. We performed a meta-analysis of the diagnostic test accuracy, along with the calculation of the pooled principal measures. We included 20 studies reporting the use of AI/ML models for the prediction of IUGR. Out of these, 10 studies were used for the quantitative meta-analysis.

Accuracy, sensitivity, and other criteria were calculated for each algorithm. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of external validation dataset for support vector machine (SVM), random forest, AdaBoost, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), decision tree, logistic regression (LR), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) were 0.780, 0.657, 0.736, 0.669, 0.774, 0.614, 0.769, 0.742, and 0.757, respectively. SVM also retained high performance in other criteria. The specificity for SVM retained 100% in the external validation set with an accuracy of 88.7%. Our prospective and multicenter study is the first clinical study that supports the GDM diagnosis for pregnant women in resource-limited areas, using only fasting blood glucose value, patients' age, and a smartphone connected to the internet. Our study proved that SVM can achieve accurate diagnosis with less operation cost and higher efficacy. Our study (referred to as GDM-AI study, ie, the study of AI-based diagnosis of GDM) also shows our app has a promising future in improving the quality of maternal health for pregnant women, precision medicine, and long-distance medical care.
